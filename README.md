# Advent-Code-2023
Charting my progress through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. 
Check out Advent of Code here: https://adventofcode.com/

## The objective
I am currently working my way through the beginning of a Computer Science Bachelor's degree and I figured that doing
some coding challenges would be a great way to reinforce my learning. After learning about Advent of Code, I decided to set myself the challenge of completing all of the coding challenges for 2023 using Java, the language I most recently started learning. My knowledge is relatively basic, but I hope that by doing these challenges I will learn something new or at the very least get better at problem-solving and writing less messy code :)
